/*his program calculates the factorial for numbers 1 through 20.  
It uses nested loops: the outer loop iterates through the numbers, 
and the inner loop calculates the factorial. The results are displayed in a tabular format.  Â  

Difficulty with Factorial of 100:

The factorial of 100 is an extremely large number that would exceed the maximum value 
that even a long data type can hold. This would lead to an overflow, resulting in an incorrect result*/
